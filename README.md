# php-practice

Welcome to this repository. It contains all my php practice files.

## What is it 

This repository will contain the code necessary for my php practice. It includes an excuse generator as well as a form test. In the "formulaire" directory, you will find test form test which includes validation and sanitization. It also takes a password confirmation and a search form.

## Who Am I

I'm a junior developer trying to get a good grip on php with projects and other things. I am currently in training at BeCode and do this as part of my training.

## How to use it ?

To use the form, you will need a local server or a distant server. You can use the ```.env.example``` file to find the structure of the informations required to allow the form to work properly. You can either remove the .example part of create a new file named ``.env``. It contains three fields : 

- a server name
- a username
- a password
- a database name

These informations will be used when creating the connection to the database for the CRUD operations.
